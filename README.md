# Telegram LLM Bot

This is a Telegram LLM Bot, with code and design adapted from [zzh1996](https://github.com/zzh1996/chatgpt-telegram-bot).

I am using Python 3.12.7, with dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, although other versions may work as well.
To start the bot, create your own `config.yml` file based on `config.example.yml`, then run `python main.py`.
